            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our yoga studio! We offer a variety of yoga classes suitable for all levels, from beginners to advanced practitioners.
                A meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it to release any suffering,<br>
                find inner peace, and salvation. Illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras,<br>
                 in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts.<br>
               The raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything. <br>
               These are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its epic Mahābhārata, the Jain Praśamaratiprakarana, <br>
               and Buddhist Nikaya texts

                     </b><br> <br>
                       <b> We’ve been welcoming new students and experienced practitioners of Iyengar yoga since 1984</b><br>when B.K.S. Iyengar helped found the centre and taught here. Our world class team is dedicated to your development.
                        True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life.  <br>Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming
                         Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied

                        <br><br><b> 1) THE FIRST IS “YOGASH CITTAVRTTI NIRODHAH”,</b><br> WHICH MEANS “SUSPENSION OF MENTAL TENDENCIES IS YOGA”. <br>
                         This definition tells us that our true self is what remains when the noise and activity of the mind have been suspended or turned off. The waves of mental activity are like curtains which hide our true nature. By calming and ultimately suspending these mental waves, we can uncover our true self.
                         
                         <br><br><b>2) THE SECOND DEFINITION IS “YOGO SAMYOGO ITYUKTO JIIVATMA PARAMATMANAHA” </b><br>WHICH MEANS “YOGA IS UNION BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SELF AND THE COSMIC SELF (GOD)”. <br>
                         (Note: Yoga explains that as God is the center of everything, He must also be the center, or “Self”, of every human being. Thus, the individual selves are many, but the Cosmic Self is one).
